\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A chord is defined as two or more notes playing simultaneously \cite{benward2014music}. This is normally achieved by playing different notes at the same time; in other cases like arpeggios and broken chords, the notes are played separately and successively. Given a music piece, the chords and their progression define the harmonic content of the piece itself \cite{papadopoulos2007large}. Analyzing chord tonality is one of the most important task in both \textit{Chord Recognition} and \textit{Song Identification} \cite{lee2006identifying}.\\

The most commonly used chords in music are \textit{triads}, which consist in groups of three notes (root, third and perfect fifth). To overcome the issue of managing chords played in different octaves, it is possible to use \textit{chromas} instead of distinct notes \cite{bartsch2005audio}. Chords can be classified as \textit{minor}, \textit{major}, \textit{diminished} and \textit{augmented}, according to the musical interval of the notes that constitute them. The name of a chord is driven from its root note. The chord is called major (minor) if the third interval is major (minor), i.e. 4 (3) semitones away from the root. All these peculiarities make \textit{Chord Recognition} a very complex task to be achieved.\\

Our report is structured as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:techniques} we present techniques that can be used to extract features from sound data to establish consequently chords. In Sec.~\ref{sec:setup} we describe two different experiments that we performed. In the first experiment we achieved \textit{Chord Recognition} using sounds containing a single chord produced by a single instrument. In the second experiment we dealt with a much more complex scenario where we used full songs that were composed by several instruments and also human voice. In Sec.~\ref{sec:results} we describe the obtained results. Finally in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusions} we comment the characteristics and the advantages of the different techniques used.
