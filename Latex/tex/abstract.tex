In this report we try to perform chord recognition, meaning the extraction of the name of a musical chord from an audio file. After describing the techniques used, we show the performance obtained in two different scenarios: the first one is a simple single-chord single-instrument kind of scenario, while the second one considers full songs.

Through the implementation of classical \textit{Machine Learning} (ML) techniques and \textit{Hidden Markov Models} (HMM) we illustrate the difficulties and show advantages of fairly complicated algorithms over the simple ones.
