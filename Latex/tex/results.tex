\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

For the first part of the experiment we simply run all the different classification methods explained in Section~\ref{sec:setup} randomly splitting the dataset into $70\%$ training and $30\%$ testing. The results can be clearly seen in Tab.~\ref{tab:singleChordResults}.

\end{tabular}

\end{table}


For the second part of the experiment we got two different kind of outputs for each song, which are $\mathcal{L}_{SVM}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{HMM}$. In order to verify the quality of ours results we compared them with  $\mathcal{L}_{Harte}$. Given $\mathcal{L}_{SVM}$ ($\mathcal{L}_{HMM}$) and $\mathcal{L}_{Harte}$ for a certain value of $r_{test}$ and for a certain extracted feature we computed the error probability counting all the matching between $\mathcal{L}_{SVM}$ ($\mathcal{L}_{HMM}$) and $\mathcal{L}_{Harte}$.

 In Tab.~\ref{tab:resultbeforeHMM} we can look at the error probabilities obtained after the first step of testing, before processing HMM. In Tab.~\ref{tab:resultafterHMM} we can look at the results obtained after the second step of testing, after processing HMM. In both cases we show different outputs depending on the testing rate $r_{test}$ and on the chosen extracted feature.

 Observing the results we make the following observations. First, we got best results with CENS features than with CLP and CRP features. We explain this remembering that for mantaing low the computational cost of our setup, we strongly limited the features extraction for CLP and CRP. Second, HMM proved to be able to enhance better results than MC-SVM alone in all the cases. This is not obvious since we worked with features of multi-instrumental sounds including also vocal parts. Indeed the chords prediction of some songs often isn't improved but is aggravated. We show this by comparing the two different results obtained with the same $\mathcal{D}_{train}$ as done in Fig.~\ref{fig:compareerror}.

\end{figure}

We concluded that HMM don't always improve our result for every single song. It is able to do so only in average. However what HMM is able to do for each song is reduce the chords variation. We define chord variation as the number of times that a chord sequence varies within the same song, therefore the number of times that $\mathcal{L}(i) \neq \mathcal{L}(i-1)$. This value decreases, since HMM tends to correct the most improbables outputs generated by MC-SVM. We find confirmation to this assumption looking at
Fig.~\ref{fig:smoothmulti} and Fig.~\ref{fig:smoothsingle}. In particular in Fig.~\ref{fig:smoothsingle} we can see how HMM removes the chord-labels that are not repeated costantly over time and therefore result less likely.
